          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            It seems like every year, there is some new fitness trend taking over that is marketed as the “latest and greatest”.  With the rise of
            technology, being sedentary has also become the new norm.  Often times people with limited fitness knowledge are participating in
            trends and injuring themselves due to no basic fitness knowledge. Every day, there are more than 10,000 people treated in
            emergency rooms across the country for injuries stemming from exercise, sports, recreation, and immobility.
            <br />
            <br />
            FitForm is an application I designed that utilizes both fitness and technology to bring people back to their foundation. Users select different
            exercises to perform, then the application will use the smart phones camera to scan their bodies and assess their form against correct form.
            Depending on the results, each user will receive suggestions for corrective exercises that will help them achieve proper body mechanics. The
            better the form, the better the results, the less injuries there are.

          <div class="research-data">
            <p>
              <h4>The Goal</h4>
              What I wanted to gain with these surveys is, an age demographic, to learn if people have a false perception of good posture during exercise,
              and <b><i>prove why</i></b> this <b><i>application is useful</i></b> to a majority of gym goers.
              </br>
              <h4>The Hypothesis</h4>
              From my experience as an educator in movement science, it is my belief that a large portion of people either have a false interpretation of what correct
              motor mechanics are for the most basic compound exercises, do not have the foundation to start these lifts, or they do not realize they are improperly
              performing. If this returns true, it could easily help many people avoid injury and the byproducts that are attributed with it.
              <h4>The Metric</h4>
              This experiment used a questionnaire to categorize people into two groups: those who said they know proper form and those who did not.
              The questionnaire also included an age range in case there was a pattern with a specific age group. Once categorized,
              each person who answered the questionnaire performed a low barbell back squat using an Olympic 45lb barbell. Participants were graded on a 1 - 5 scale
              based off of proper limb positioning throughout the concentric and eccentric parts of the lift, where 4 and 5 are considered a success.
              <h4>The Data</h4>
              <b>Statistics for the group A - people who said they knew proper body mechanics for squatting</b>
              <ul>
                <li>This group consisted of 65% of respondents</li>
                <li>Out of the 65% that said they knew proper form, 61% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
                <li>Of the 61% of who failed, 76% were between the age of 18 and 34</li>
              </ul>

              <b>Statistics for the group B - people who said they did NOT know proper body mechanics for squatting</b>
              <ul>
                <li>This group consisted of 35% of the respondents</li>
                <li>Out of the 35% that did not know proper form, 71% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
                <li>Of the 71% who failed, 28% were between the ages of 18 and 24</li>
              </ul>

              <b>An additional survey showed:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>About 60% of people used free weights</li>
                <li>74% said they have never worked with a trainer</li>
                <li>75% of free weight users fell within the 18-34 years of age demographic</li>
                <li>75% of people who marked they had been injured in the gym were between the ages of 18 and 34.</li>
              </ul>

              The functional screening to determine exercise mastery was done to demonstrate if users were knowledgeable of proper motor mechanics during common
              lifts. The results were relatively shocking with over 65% of participants performing the exercise incorrectly. Chances are this pattern follows into
              other multi-joint/compound exercises. This survey, as well as my own experiences, are instrumental in demonstrating to possible FitForm users on the
              landing page the percentage of gym goers who have a false perception of what correct exercise posture is for even basic movements.

            FitForm will be available for everyone, therefore prior to building the initial wireframes it was important to understand the variety of people who will be
            using the app. So no matter what the users knowledge is, limits and capabilities, age, or any other variable, there will be something for them and it will be easy to use.
            The personas created were designed to depict people with various fitness levels, goals, and pain points. The personas also presented us with information
            from our users in regards to what types of features they were looking for on a fitness application.

              Because of the nature of only creating a landing page and because it was a new idea, it was important to know exactly what users would be

              be most important. Based off of the current information and data I had, below were the initial three wireframes that I had produced.
