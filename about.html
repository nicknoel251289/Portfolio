          <h1>Who am I?!</h1>
          <p>
            My journey is a long one, but whose isn’t. I’ll start by saying, I LOVE drawing! I’m pretty sure I popped
            out with a pad and pen in my hands. Growing up, I was constantly drawing. Whether it was random doodles or
            the trendiest Pokémon, I couldn’t put the pencil down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon graduating from college with a BFA, I realized there wasn’t much I could do with just a fine arts degree.
            I decided I wanted to combine my love for both art and computers, so I tried to teach myself graphic design.
            Deciding to make a career out of front end development and graphic design has led me to discover the UI/UX Design
            track at BLOC. While completing the course, I also obtained my NASM-CPT and became a personal trainer to
            supplement income.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a personal trainer, I have built countless workout plans individualized around having to understand what the
            client needs. Similar to how UX needs to empathize with its users, being a trainer requires an emotional and
            trusting connection with the client to obtain their end goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had every type of ailment, problem, or challenge, personal to each prospect, come across my desk. Once that
            prospect becomes my client, I interview them to gain as much information about who they are and what possible
            issues they deal with. What energizes me the most is a client with an issue I haven't dealt with before. It's a
            new challenge that allows me to explore new areas that I haven't before. In order for both the client or myself
            to be successful, I have to know what obstacles I am dealing with. It's not sarcasm when I say the fun continues
            every 2 or 3 weeks when I redesign workouts around updated data and other interfering variables. To have continued
            success, constant iteration of periodized plans is critical, which is exactly like the flow of wireframing and
            user testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to adapt a periodized plan to fit the person's interest and their needs is similar to that of UX design:
            the user is always in mind but it still needs to be functional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a student at BLOC has only affirmed my decision to make this a career.  I've had the opportunity to see my
            designs come to life on several projects.  For example,  FitForm is an idea I've had for a fitness app/website.
            With the skills I've learned, I was able to design and create the website from scratch.  Additionally, PBNation is
            a forum that was in desperate need of a makeover.  Not only was it unattractive, it was difficult for users to access
            the information they needed.  With my redesign, users were able to find what they needed in a quarter of the time.
            Both projects had their unique challenges, but have only increased my excitement for future design opportunities.
